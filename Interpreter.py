''' 1- Lexical analysis: is the first phase of a compiler. 
    Its main job is to read the input source code and convert it into meaningful
    units called tokens. This is done by a component of the compiler or interpreter
    known as the lexer or lexical analyzer.The result will be a stream of tokens 
    for each line of the code. 

    2- Parsing: Once the lexical analysis is complete, the next stage is parsing. 
    The parser takes the stream of tokens produced by the lexer and builds a data
    structure known as a parse tree or syntax tree. This tree represents the 
    grammatical structure of the program.
